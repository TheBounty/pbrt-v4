###Why this fork..??

Some personal reasons why I have created this fork..(wip)

I've always wanted to learn raytracing.. since the first time I saw a Pov-Ray 2.0 render.
That scene that was drawn slowly, line by line, on the screen of an old 386 sx,
until completing a image of a checkered plane, on which rested a red, brilliant and perfect sphere.
